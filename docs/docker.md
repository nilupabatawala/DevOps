 ### Docker Image Optimization

Application developers, aiming to keep your container image size under control‚ùì

Maintaining a lean image is vital for:
‚ö° Quicker deployments
üí∞Reduced storage costs

Here are some top tips to achieve thisüëá

1 **Minimize Layers**: Combine commands in your Dockerfile to limit the number of layers. Each instruction adds a new layer. Use multi-line commands to combine instructions, minimizing layers.

2 **Multi-Stage Builds**: Separate the build environment from the runtime environment using multi-stage builds. This approach lets you create application artifacts in one stage and transfer only essential files to the final image.

3 **Package Managers**: When installing dependencies, remove unnecessary files and clear package manager caches to shrink the size of installed packages.

4 **Opt for a Minimal Base Image**: Start with a minimal base image, such as Red Hat UBI, to keep the initial image size down.

5 **Use .dockerignore**: Employ a .dockerignore file to exclude unneeded files and directories from the build context, helping to reduce image size.

6 **Single Responsibility Principle**: Ensure each container has a single responsibility. Avoid packing multiple services or applications into one container, as this can inflate the image size.

7 **Optimize File Copying**: When copying files into the image, include only what is necessary and use wildcards to select multiple files.
